# <JavaScript PW Generator>

## Description

Hello! This is my first ever Javascript project. This Javascript project is a Password Generator that generators a password for you! It'll ask you how long your password will be, if you like to add special characters, capital letters, lowe cases letters, and numbers! This project helped me understand on what Java can do, and how it works!
